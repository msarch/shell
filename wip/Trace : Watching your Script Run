Watching your script run

It is possible to have bash show you what it is doing when you run your script. To do this, use the set command within your script to turn tracing on and off. Use set -x to turn tracing on and set +x to turn tracing off. For example.:

#!/bin/bash

number=1

set -x
if [ $number = "1" ]; then
    echo "Number equals 1"
else
    echo "Number does not equal 1"
fi
set +x
